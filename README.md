 <h1>Purpose</h1>
 I wanted to see if I am capable or I am smart Enough to make such a project. The hardest part was algoritmic calculations for the numbers.
 
<h1>Setup</h1>
To run the project you need.

- [Java 11 Corretto](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html)
- [JavaFX runtime](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)

You need Java version 11 and JavaFX runtime version 17. Because the project was made with an old version of it, 21 doesn't work because some features break the build of the project.

Once you have JavaFX you need to define the path to the `lib` folder in the project settings inside path variables.
